# mtm6201_final - Plant Palette

## Overview
This is the final project website for the MTM6201 course at Algonquin College. The project showcases a fully responsive, accessible vegan resturant website using Bootstrap and custom design features.

## My Process
I began by sketching out my low-fi wireframes using Figma from our UX design class. I then created the Hi-fi frames to my liking creating the final mockup which can be found in my image folder. Going off of this I then built the structure using HTML and Bootstrap. I customized the default Bootstrap theme with CSS variables to match my brand’s colour palette. ensured mobile responsiveness by testing on various screen sizes and used semantic HTML with ARIA roles for accessibility. While trying to create my website the closest I could to my mockup I ended up switching a few things around to my better liking and I switched a few images out because I found better quality images and overall just images I prefered better for my website. I also had to change out my fonts and I'll say why in the section below.

## Challenges
- **Fonts:** One of the first challenges that I encountered right away was that the original fonts I had chosen on figma were not found in google fonts so I had to re-choose fonts from google fonts that I could download and incorporate into my website. But in all honesty, I also just liked these fonts better than the original ones I chose.
- **Accessibility:** The next challenge for me was ensuring the site was fully accesible and navigable with a keyboard and screen readers. It took me a few tries but I was able to work trhough it and do multiple accessibility testing to make sure I acheived it.
- **Responsive Images:** I had to optimise all of my image sizes and experiment with the `<picture>` tag to achieve a fluid, responsive image layout. Some of them still take some time to load in but I've tried and did the best I could.
- **Custom Styling:** Integrating Bootstrap with my own design language required redefining several default classes using CSS variables. Took me some playing around but I eventually figured it out to how I wanted it. 

## What I Learned
- I learned how to build a responsive, accessible website using modern frameworks and best practices.
- I learned the importance of semantic structure and keyboard accessibility.
- I learned how to integrate multiple libraries and tools into one cohesive project such as css library and bootstrap.
- I've learned how to use css to customize or change bootstrap properties.
- And finally I learned that nothing is too hard if u really try and put ur mind to it. I thought I'd never be able to code a full responsive and accessible website yet here I am today. Coding has definielty not been my strong suit but I have really seen my self excel during this semester and I am proud with how much I have learned and how much I am able to acheive. Thank you for the great semester Rob! Never thought id actually enjoy coding but I will admit I had alot of fun doing this one!
